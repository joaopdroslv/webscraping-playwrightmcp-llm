## How to Run

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and run the example.

1. Configure your `.env` file using `.env.example` as a reference.
   Make sure to set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. Start the Playwright MCP service:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d playwright-mcp
    ```

3. Build the workflow service:
    ```bash
    docker compose build workflow
    ```

4. Then run the workflow service (It is not a persistent service):
    ```bash
    docker compose up workflow
    ```
    The output generated by the workflow service will be saved in the output/ directory located at the project root.

    `Note:` Since the workflow service is not persistent — it runs once and exits after completing the workflow.
    To run the workflow again, use:
    ```bash
    docker compose up workflow
    ```
